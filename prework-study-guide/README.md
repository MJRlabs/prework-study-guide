# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

This webpage is meant to serve as a study guide and learning tool for all the Prework for a edX coding bootcamp. The goal is to provide a central point of reference and application of the principles put forth in the prework portion of the bootcamp. This was built to practice and implement beginner level HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript concepts. This project creates a place for reliablely referencing notes that did not before exist. I learned some strong foundations as it relates to the aformentioned programming languages and how to better interact with Git and GitHub.
